This week marks the end of the focus on software development, and a shift into the report writing phase. Though, that said, there's still a few little things which have been worked on.

Now there's support for a new OLAN modifier - the full manoeuvre scaling. This comes in a different format to the other modifiers, instead being a different figure which comes before the manoeuvre figure. An example scales the whole `d` manoeuvre by two.

This also comes with a refactor & cleanup of a lot of code in the manoeuvre and OLAN interpretation, which is all a lot more comprehensible & reusable.

That's more or less it, in terms of code. A lot of progress has already been made on the report, with a fair bit of the background written up and lot of ideas to be fleshed out written in. A poster, which is also a work in progress, has also been added to the project. This will give a rough overview of a number of elements of the project.

No demo this week I'm afraid, since not much functionality has been added, there's not much point really.
