# Week twelve

This has been another week with a focus on report writing. Most of the code contributions have been refactors to reinforce the design.

One of the major refactors this week has been focused on reinforcing the model-view-controller nature of the architecture, mainly around the controller part of the application. It was noted that the controller classes - `OLANdroid`, `AnimationManager`, `ManoeuvreCatalogue` and `FlightManager` are prime candidates for becoming singletons. Introducing this design pattern to a greater extent strengthened the cohesion of the controller, and reduced the dependency on the `OLANdroid` application class, which was becoming a bit of a 'god class'.
