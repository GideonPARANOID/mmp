# OLANdroid

A tool for visual modelling acrobatic aeroplane flight. See the [development diary](https://github.com/GideonPARANOID/olandroid/wiki) & [demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFyZMqjrwPwacU4OqQyIyKR6jJGp6z2Kw).

## Running the application

There's two different ways of doing this.

1. Request to join the [Google+ beta testing group](https://plus.google.com/communities/111527779897334123267), which will provide a link to the application on the Play store.
2. Transfer `rel/app-release.apk` onto an Android device, allow installs from unknown sources (it's self signed code) and install the application.
